Adds on top of Milestone A:
- Batch‑Prep Guide (weekend + midweek) with combined tasks and time estimates
- Improved ingredient parsing from Spoonacular `extendedIngredients`
- Budget/store tweaks: preferred store per category + swap prompts
- Quota guard + Library‑only fallback + Search breadth controls (Narrow/Balanced/Wide)
- H‑E‑B prefill list + MyFitnessPal CSV export

Secrets:
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY = "your-key"
